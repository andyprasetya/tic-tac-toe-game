# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This game is built by using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v.14.18.1.

Published version: [The OpenSE7EN](https://opense7en.com/tic-tac-toe/).

### Change / diff. items:
1. Switch CSS framework from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS.
2. Remove jQuery, use vanilla JavaScript.
3. Add scalability to the game board size: 3x3, 6x6 and 9x9. Why not be unlimited? I think about mobile devices and UX aspects. Does anybody want to play 100x100 tic-tac-toe?
4. Simple scoring visualisation.
5. Flexible game algorithm.
